  return "hello NPM! timcrocodile is talking! i'm TimCrocodile and let me briefly introduce my ancestors. Crocodiles have been around for 240 million years, appearing 25 million years before the first dinosaurs and 100 million years before the first birds and mammals. Crocodiles that lived 230 millions years ago were up to 40 feet long. Our primate ancestors were ratty little things that went around stealing eggs, Dr. Perran Ross, a crocodile specialist and professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at the University of Florida, told the New York Times. Ancestral crocodiles had basically the same body plan we see today, apparently because it works.Crocodiles are regarded as the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. They have many dinosaur-like features including bird-like arrangements of the hip bones, and teeth that are mounted in sockets rather than being fused directly to the jawbone. Recent taxonomic analysis has reasoned that dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds should be classified in same the branch of animals.Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes, geckos and other reptiles. Birds and crocodiles, for example, have sophisticated four chambered hearts, while lizards and snakes have only three chambers. A four-chamber heart boosts brain performance and offers more flexibility to changing environments than a three-chamber heart. Crocodiles display a number of bird-like behaviors such as building good nests, and brooding, protecting and fussing over their eggs.The Egyptians revered crocodiles. Their river god Sobek is modeled after one. Entire crocodiles families were mummified and placed in sacred tombs with gold bracelets placed on their ankles. A Greek historian visiting an Egyptian Crocodileopolis saw priests feed them honey wine and cakes. Winston Churchill was among those who did not look upon crocodiles with the same affection. He once wrote : I avow...an active hatred of these brutes and a desire to kill them. ";
